## 🌟 Overview

This project analyzes **40+ macroeconomic indicators** across **20 countries** (2010-2023) to predict GDP per capita and identify the key drivers of economic prosperity. Using advanced feature engineering and multiple machine learning models, we achieve **95%+ prediction accuracy** and uncover actionable insights for policymakers and investors.

**Key Highlights:**
- 📊 Analyzed 14 years of World Bank data
- 🔬 Engineered 60+ custom features
- 🤖 Tested 5 different ML models
- 🎯 Achieved R² > 0.96 on test data
- 💡 Identified technology infrastructure as the #1 predictor

## 🎯 Motivation

### The Challenge

Gross Domestic Product (GDP) per capita is the gold standard for measuring economic prosperity, but understanding what drives it is complex. Traditional economic analysis often focuses on a handful of variables, but in today's interconnected world, prosperity is influenced by everything from internet penetration to infant mortality rates.

### Why This Matters

**For Policymakers:**
- Identify high-impact areas for investment
- Understand which interventions yield the greatest returns
- Prioritize development initiatives based on data

**For Investors:**
- Assess country-level growth potential
- Identify undervalued economies
- Make data-driven allocation decisions

**For Researchers:**
- Understand complex economic relationships
- Validate economic theories with modern data
- Explore causal mechanisms

### Research Questions

1. **Can we accurately predict GDP per capita from observable indicators?**
2. **Which factors matter most for economic prosperity?**
3. **How do different dimensions (education, health, technology) interact?**
4. **Are there universal patterns across diverse economies?**

---

## 🔬 Methodology

### 1. Data Collection & Cleaning

```python
# Retrieve data from World Bank API
import wbdata
data = wbdata.get_dataframe(indicators, country=countries, date=(2010, 2023))

# Handle missing values
- Country-specific median imputation
- Global median fallback
- Drop indicators with >50% missing data
```

### 2. Feature Engineering (60+ Features)

**Growth Rates:**
- Year-over-year percentage changes for key indicators
- Captures economic momentum and trends

**Composite Indices:**
- Human Capital Index (life expectancy + education + literacy)
- Infrastructure Index (internet + electricity + mobile)
- Economic Diversification Index (industry + services)

**Interaction Terms:**
- Internet users × Tertiary education (tech-educated workforce)
- Life expectancy × Unemployment (health-labor relationship)
- Urban population × Services sector (urbanization effect)

**Temporal Features:**
- Lagged variables (previous year's values)
- Moving averages (3-year rolling means)
- Growth acceleration (second derivatives)

**Transformations:**
- Log transformations for skewed distributions
- Squared terms for non-linear relationships

- F-regression scores for all features
- P-value filtering (significance testing)
- Selected top 40 features by statistical importance

**Correlation Analysis:**
- Identified highly correlated features
- Removed redundant information
- Preserved interpretability

### 4. Model Training

**Train-Test Split:**
- Country-level split (not random sampling)
- 75% training countries, 25% test countries
- Prevents data leakage and ensures generalization

**Models Tested:**
1. Linear Regression (baseline)
2. Ridge Regression (L2 regularization)
3. Lasso Regression (feature selection via L1)
4. Random Forest (ensemble of 300 trees)
5. Gradient Boosting (sequential learning, 300 estimators)

**Validation:**
